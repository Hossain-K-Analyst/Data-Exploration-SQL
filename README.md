Suicide Rates Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of suicide rates data from 1985 to 2016 across different countries and age groups. The dataset used for this analysis is collected from Kaggle.

Overview
Suicide is a critical public health issue that affects individuals and communities worldwide. This project aims to gain insights into suicide trends and patterns over the years by examining data on total suicides, highest suicide years, and global suicide rates.

Data Exploration
Total Suicides by Country (Map): We visualize the total number of suicides across countries using an interactive map, providing a comprehensive view of how suicide rates vary geographically over the entire period from 1985 to 2016.

Highest Suicide Year Around the World: By analyzing the data, we identify the year with the highest number of suicides globally. Understanding this peak year is essential for identifying potential causes and designing targeted interventions.

Highest Global Suicide Rate: We also analyze the data to determine the highest suicide rate observed during the 12-year period under investigation. This information will help us understand which year had the highest proportion of suicides in relation to the population.

Age Differences
We explore the data to understand how suicide rates vary among different age groups. Analyzing age differences in suicide trends can help in developing targeted strategies to address specific vulnerabilities.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on suicide rates from 1985 to 2016. The dataset is provided by Russell Yates and offers a comprehensive overview of global suicide trends.

Data Processing and Analysis
To conduct this analysis, we utilize various data processing techniques, visualizations, and statistical methods. The programming language and tools used for analysis will be mentioned in the project code.
